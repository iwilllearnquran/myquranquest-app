Repository Overview

This GitHub repo iwilllearnquran/myquranquest-app is an Expo-based React Native app. It uses file-based routing, TypeScript, and the standard Expo stack. This setup lets users test the app via Expo Go or run it on emulators or simulators. The current README.md reflects the default template from create-expo-app: install, start, and basic instructions.

# My Qur’an Quest

A mobile learning app built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) and React Native to help you explore the Qur’an journey—right from your pocket.

##  Features

- Clean UI with intuitive navigation using file-based routing.
- Supports development & testing via Expo Go.
- TypeScript for safer, scalable code.
- Prepared for EAS builds (APK, AAB, Dev Client).

##  Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
- **Yarn** or **npm**
- **Expo CLI**:  
  ```sh
  npm install --global expo-cli


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

--------------------------folder structure---------------------------------------


Great question 👍 Let me break down the **Expo + React Native project structure** you have in your repo (`myquranquest-app`). Since your repo was scaffolded with **create-expo-app (router template)**, here’s what each folder and file generally does:

---

## 📂 Project Structure Explanation

### 1. **`app/`**

This is the **heart of your app**. Expo Router uses **file-based routing** — meaning the file/folder structure inside `app/` automatically maps to screens and navigation.

* `app/_layout.tsx` → Defines a **layout** (navigation container, headers, tab bars, etc.) for all nested screens.
* `app/index.tsx` → The **home screen** (what shows up when you launch the app).
* `app/[...missing].tsx` (sometimes) → Handles 404 or fallback routes.

👉 Anything you put inside here (e.g., `app/settings.tsx`) becomes a new screen automatically.

---

### 2. **`assets/`**

Holds static files like:

* Images (`logo.png`, icons, splash images)
* Fonts
* JSON files (if you need them for localization, data, etc.)

These are bundled with the app.

---

### 3. **`node_modules/`**

Standard Node folder where **all dependencies** are installed (React Native, Expo libraries, etc.).
⚠️ Don’t edit manually — it’s generated by `npm install` or `yarn`.

---

### 4. **`.expo/`**

Auto-generated when you run `expo start`.
Stores local Expo settings, cache, and connection info.
⚠️ Safe to delete — it will be recreated.

---

### 5. **`.expo-shared/`**

Stores configuration shared between team members (like assets metadata).
Mostly managed automatically.

---

### 6. **`.git/`**

Hidden folder for Git version control. Tracks commits, branches, and pushes to GitHub.
⚠️ Don’t edit manually.

---

### 7. **`eas.json`**

Configuration for **EAS Build** (Expo Application Services).
Defines profiles like:

* `development` → dev builds
* `preview` → internal distribution
* `production` → store builds (AAB for Play Store)

---

### 8. **`app.json` / `app.config.ts`**

Main Expo **configuration file**:

* App name, slug, icon, splash screen
* iOS/Android package identifiers
* Permissions
* Background color (e.g., `#f1f1f1` for your app)

---

### 9. **`package.json`**

Standard Node project file:

* Lists dependencies (e.g., `expo`, `react-native`, `expo-router`)
* Scripts (e.g., `npm start`, `eas build`)

---

### 10. **`tsconfig.json`**

TypeScript configuration:

* Compiler settings
* Path aliases
* Strictness rules

Helps with type safety and autocompletion.

---

### 11. **`babel.config.js`**

Configures Babel (the JS/TS compiler).
Expo apps use it to enable features like decorators, path aliases, etc.

---

### 12. **`.gitignore`**

Lists files/folders Git should **ignore** (e.g., `node_modules`, `.expo`, build artifacts).

---

### 13. **Other files you may see**

* **`README.md`** → Documentation for your repo (you’re improving this).
* **`metro.config.js`** (optional) → Custom Metro bundler config if needed.
* **`LICENSE`** → License file (if you add one).

---

✅ In summary:

* **`app/`** → Screens & navigation
* **`assets/`** → Static files (images/fonts)
* **`app.json` & `eas.json`** → App + build config
* **Project root files** → Tooling setup (TypeScript, Babel, Git)

---

👉 Do you want me to generate a **tree view of your repo** (like `tree /f` style) so I can explain **each actual file inside your project**, not just the typical Expo structure?



Nice 🚀 let’s make your **README** much more contributor-friendly by adding a **visual project tree** + explanations for each folder/file.

Since I don’t yet have your exact file list, I’ll assume the **standard Expo Router template** and create a structured section. Once you paste/upload your `tree` output, I’ll refine it to match exactly.

👉 This section makes it crystal clear for **new contributors or teammates** what lives where.  

Would you like me to **embed this tree view directly into the README I wrote earlier**, so it’s one polished file you can copy-paste into your repo?

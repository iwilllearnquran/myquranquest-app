Repository Overview

This GitHub repo iwilllearnquran/myquranquest-app is an Expo-based React Native app. It uses file-based routing, TypeScript, and the standard Expo stack. This setup lets users test the app via Expo Go or run it on emulators or simulators. The current README.md reflects the default template from create-expo-app: install, start, and basic instructions.

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
